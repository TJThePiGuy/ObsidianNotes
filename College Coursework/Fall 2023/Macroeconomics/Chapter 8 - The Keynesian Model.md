**John Maynard Keynes** - British economist (1883â€“1946) whose influential work offered an explanation of the Great Depression and suggested, as a cure, that the government should play an active role in the economy
### Classical Theory and the Keynesian Revolution
- **Classical economists** - group of economists whose theory dominated economic thinking from the 1770s to the Great Depression
	- believed recessions would naturally cure themselves because the price system would automatically restore full employment.
	- flexible prices (including flexible wages and interest rates) in competitive markets bring all markets to full-employment equilibrium
	- **Say's Law** - supply creates its own demand
		- long-term underspending is impossible because the production of goods and services generates an equal amount of total spending for these goods and services
	- unemployment is only temporary as wages and prices decline, or is the result of people who voluntarily choose not to work at lower wages
	- there is a natural tendency for the economy to restore full employment over time. 
- **Keynes's Theory** - demand creates its own supply
	- aggregate expenditures determine real GDP, employment, and income
- **Consumption function** - graph or table that shows the amount households spend for goods and services at different levels of real disposable income
	- Slope is **marginal propensity to consume (MPC)** - change in consumption resulting from a given change in real disposable income $$\text{MPC}=\frac{\Delta \text{ real consumption}}{\Delta \text{ real disposable income}}=\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y_{d}}$$
	- Y-intercept is **Autonomous consumption** - consumption that is independent of the level of real disposable income
- **Dissaving** - amount by which real personal consumption expenditures exceed real disposable income
	- vertical distance below the consumption function to the *45-degree line*
- **Saving** - part of disposable income households **do not spend** for consumer goods and services
	- vertical distance above the consumption function to the *45-degree line*
- **Marginal propensity to save (MPS)** - change in saving resulting from a given change in real disposable income
- $$\text{MPS}=1-\text{MPC}=\frac{\Delta \text{ saving}}{\Delta \text{ real disposable income}}=\frac{\Delta S}{\Delta Y_{d}}$$
### Reasons the Consumption Function Shifts
- **Non-income factors** cause consumption function to shift
	- Consumer expectations (future inflation rate, likelihood of unemployment, likelihood of higher income) can shift curve
		- Optimistic expectations shift curve upward, Pessimistic expectations shift curve downward
	- More wealth $\to$ more spending $\to$ upward shift of consumption function
		- **Wealth effect** - shift in the consumption function caused by a change in the value of real and financial assets
	- Change in purchasing power of financial assets with fixed nominal value can shift consumption function
		- Raise in price level $\to$ decrease in real wealth $\to$ shift downward
	- Interest rates fall $\to$ upward shift of curve
### Investment Expenditures
- Keynes argued expectations of future profits are primary factor in determining investment
- **Investment demand curve** - curve that shows the amount businesses spend for investment goods at different possible rates of interest
	- changes in the interest rate generate movements along investment demand curve
	- factors that changes expected rate of profit shifts the investment demand curve $\to$ changes the investment spending component of aggregate expenditures
		- Expectations, technological change, capacity utilization, business taxes shift curve
- *Businesses will undertake all planned investment projects for which the expected rate of profit exceeds or equals the interest rate.*
- **Autonomous Expenditure** - spending that does not vary with the level of real disposable income
		- remain a fixed amount, regardless of the level of disposable income
