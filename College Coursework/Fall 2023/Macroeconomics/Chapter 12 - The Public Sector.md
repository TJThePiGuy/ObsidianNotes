### Government size and growth
- **Government expenditures** - federal, state, and local government outlays for goods and services, including transfer payments

#### Government Expenditure Patterns
- Largest category in federal budget in 2020 was *income security*
	- "Security” means these payments provide income to the elderly or disadvantaged, including Social Security, Medicare, unemployment compensation, public assistance (welfare), federal retirement, and disability benefits
		- 35% of income security expenditures was spent for Social Security and 25% for Medicare
- dominant trend in federal government spending between 1970 and 2020 was an increase in the redistribution-of-income role of the federal government and a decrease in the portion of the budget spent for defense
- The government’s share of total economic activity has generally increased since World War II
	- most of the growth in combined government expenditures as a percentage of GDP reflects growing federal government transfer programs.

### Financing Government Budgets
- largest revenue source in 2020 was individual income taxes
- second was social insurance taxes
	- include payroll taxes paid by employers and employees for Social Security, workers’ compensation, and unemployment insurance
- third best revenue collector was corporate income taxes
- **Excise tax** - a sales tax on the purchase of a particular good or service
	- contributed 3 percent of total tax receipts. 
- “Other” category includes receipts from taxes such as customs duties, estate taxes, and gift taxes

### The Art of Taxation

#### The Benefits-Received Principle
- **Benefits-received principle** - the concept that those who benefit from government expenditures should pay taxes that finance their benefits
	- gasoline tax
		- applying benefit-cost analysis, voters will approve additional highways only if the benefits they receive exceed the costs in gasoline taxes they must pay for highway construction and repairs
- the nature of public goods often makes it impossible to apply this principle
- there are other goods and services for which the benefits-received principle is inconsistent with societal goals
	- to ask families receiving food stamps to pay all the taxes required to finance their welfare benefits

#### The Ability-to-Pay Principle
- **Ability-to-pay principle** - the concept that those who have higher incomes can afford to pay a greater proportion of their income in taxes, regardless of benefits received
	- the rich may send their children to private schools or use private hospitals, but they should bear a heavier tax burden because they are better able to pay
	- difficulty lies in determining exactly how much more the higher-income individual should pay in taxes to ensure they are paying a “fair” amount

#### Progressive, Regressive, and Proportional Taxes
- **Progressive tax** - tax that charges a higher percentage of income as income rises
	- our federal individual income tax is a progressive tax because the average tax rate rises as income increases.
- **Average tax rate** - tax divided by income
$$
\text{Average tax rate} = \frac{\text{total tax due}}{\text{total taxable income}}
$$
- **Marginal tax rate** - fraction of additional income paid in taxes
$$
\text{Marginal tax rate} = \frac{\text{change in taxes due}}{\text{change in taxable income}}
$$
- **Regressive tax** - tax that charges lower percentage of income as income rises
	- decreasing average and marginal tax rates as income rises
	- sales and excise taxes are regressive taxes
	- an example of a regressive tax is the Social Security payroll tax, FICA. 
		- payroll tax is a fixed percentage (currently 6.2 percent) levied on each worker’s earnings and deducted from the worker’s paycheck by the employer
		- payroll taxes are regressive for two reasons
			- only wages and salaries are subject to this tax, while other sources of income, such as interest and dividends, are not
				- because wealthy individuals typically receive a larger portion of their income from sources other than wages and salaries than lower-income individuals do, the wealthy pay a smaller fraction of their total income in payroll taxes
			- second, earnings above a certain level are exempt from the Social Security tax
				- the marginal tax rate above a given threshold level is zero
				- any additional dollars earned above this figure add no additional taxes, and the average tax rate falls
	- property taxes are also considered regressive for two reasons
		- property owners add this tax to the rent paid by tenants who generally are lower-income persons
		- second, property taxes are a higher percentage of income for poor families than rich families because the poor spend a much greater proportion of their incomes for housing
	
- **Proportional tax** - tax that charges the same percentage of income, regardless of size of income
	- aka *flat tax*, *flat tax rate*
	- most flat-tax proposals are not truly proportional because they exempt income below some level and are, therefore, somewhat progressive

### Public Choice Theory
- **Public choice theory** - analysis of the government's decision-making process for allocating resources
	- private-market failure is the reason for government intervention in markets
	- theory of public choice considers how well the government performs when it replaces or regulates a private market
- **Benefit-cost analysis** - comparison of additional rewards and costs of an economic alternative
	- benefit will be extra revenue from selling product
	- cost is opportunity cost of using resources to make product
	-  undertaking a program whose cost exceeds its benefit is an inefficient waste of resources
	- In the long run, any firm that does not follow the benefit-cost rule will either go out of business or switch to producing products that yield benefits equal to or greater than their costs.
	- Majority-rule voting, however, can result in the approval of projects whose costs outweigh their benefits. 
		- majority-rule voting can make the correct benefit-cost marginal analysis, but it can also lead to a rejection of projects with marginal total benefits that exceed their marginal total costs. 
- Why is there a distinction between political majority voting and benefit-cost analysis? 
	- dollars can measure the intensity of voter preferences and “one-person, one-vote” does not
	- A count of ballots can determine whether a proposal passes or fails, but this count may not be proportional to the dollar strength of benefits among the individual voters
- **Special-interest effect** - when the government approves programs that benefit only a small group within society, but society as a whole pays the cost
	- influence of special-interest groups is indeed a constant problem for effective government because the benefits of government programs to certain small groups are great and the costs are relatively insignificant to each taxpayer
- **Logrolling** - political practice of trading votes of support for legislated programs
	- “You vote for my dairy price support bill, and I will vote for your tobacco price support bill.” 
- **Rational ignorance** - the voter’s choice to remain uninformed because the marginal cost of obtaining information is higher than the marginal benefit from knowing it
	- frequent charge in elections is that the candidates are not talking about the issues. 
	- One explanation is that the candidates realize that a sizable portion of the voters will make a calculated decision not to judge the candidates based on in-depth knowledge of their positions on a wide range of issues. 
	- Instead of going to the trouble of reading position papers and doing research, many voters choose their candidates based simply on party affiliation or on how the candidate appears on television.
	- explains why eligible voters fail to vote on election day
		- A popular explanation is that low voter participation results from apathy among potential voters, but the decision can be an exercise in practical benefit-cost analysis. 
		- Nonvoters presumably perceive that the opportunity cost of going to the polls outweighs the benefit gained from any of the candidates or issues on the ballot. 
		- Moreover, nonvoters perceive that one extra vote is unlikely to change the outcome. 
	- Public choice theorists argue that one reason benefits are difficult to measure is that the voter confronts an indivisible public service. 
		- In a grocery store, the consumer can decide to spend so much on apples, oranges, and other *divisible* items
		- Voting involves candidates who take stands on *many issues*
- **Bureaucracy** - body of nonelected officials and administrators who operate government agencies
	- as government grows, bureaucracy may become more powerful than the executive, legislative, and judicial branches
	- government bureaucracy tends to be inefficient because of the absence of the profit motive
- **Shortsightedness effect** - both voters and politicians suffer from a short time horizon
