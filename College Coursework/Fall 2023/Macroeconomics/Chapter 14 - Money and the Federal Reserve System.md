### What Makes Money?
- **Barter** - the direct exchange of one good or service for another good or service
	- requires a *conscious of wants*
#### Three Functions of Money
- **Money** - anything that serves as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value
	- **Medium of exchange** - primary function of money to be widely accepted in exchange for goods and services
		- removes the problem of *conscious of wants* because everyone is willing to accept money as payment rather than haggling over relative value of services
		- it is possible that widespread adoption of privately issued digital cash will ultimately replace government-issued currency
	- GDP is *money value* of final goods and services used to compare national output of nations
	- **Unit of account** - function of money to provide a common measurement of relative value of goods and services
		- Without dollars, there is no common denominator
	- **Store of value** - ability of money to hold value over time
		- can save money and be confident that you can spend it in the future
		- hyperinflation can destroy money's store-of-value function and , in turn, its medium-of-exchange function
#### Are Credit Cards Money?
- First, credit cards are widely accepted
	- serve as a means of payment
- Second, credit card statement, *not card itself*, serves as unit of account
- Credit cards fail to meet store-of-value criterion
	- *credit* - receiving money today to buy products in return for a promise to pay in the future
	- represents only a prearranged short-term loan up to a certain limit
- Therefore, credit cards to not store value and **are not money**

#### Desirable Properties of Money
- **Liquid** - money should be immediately available to spend in exchange for goods and services *without any additional expense*
- **Scarcity** - limited amount, but not too limited
	- Picasso paintings - too scarce
	- Sand - not scarce enough
	- Counterfeiting threatens scarcity of money
		- Advances in computer graphics, scanners, and color copiers were allowing counterfeiters to win their ongoing battle with the U.S. Secret Service. 
		- In response, new bills were issued with a polymer security thread running through them. 
		- The larger off-center portraits on the bills allow for a watermark next to the portrait that is visible from both sides against a light
- **Portability** - able to be carried easily
	- Statues of George Washington - not portable
- **Divisibility** - ability to make change
- **Homogeneity** - uniformity
	- All $1 bills are the same
	- Oz. of gold is an oz. of gold
- **Durability** - *not desirable*
- Bitcoins are money - satisfy all properties of money as well as have the desirable properties of money

#### What Stands Behind Our Money
- **Commodity money** - anything that serves as money while also having market vale based on material which it is made
	- Precious metals, tobacco, cows, other tangible goods
- **Fiat money** - money accepted by law, not because of its redeemability or its intrinsic value
	- Dollar bill contains only 3 cents worth of materials, yet still has $1 of value
- Why are people still willing to accept it as payment even though it has no intrinsic value? 
	- Because they are confident in the U.S. government’s ability to keep inflation under control and, therefore, to maintain its purchasing power over time. 
	- If that confidence erodes, then that fiat money may cease to serve the functions of money and may become worthless. 
- The dollar is **not** backed by gold or silver or anything else tangible. Instead, it is backed by the public’s confidence in the government’s ability to keep its purchasing power relatively stable over time. 
### Money Supply Definitions
#### M1: The Most Narrowly Defined Money Supply
- **M1** - measures the currency and checkable deposits held by the public at a given time, such as a given day, month, or year
$$
\text{M1}=\text{currency}+\text{checkable deposits}
$$
- **Currency** - coins and paper money (officially called Federal Reserve notes) that the public holds for immediate spending
- **Checkable deposits** - total money in financial institutions that can be withdrawn "on demand" by writing a check
	- often called *demand deposit* because it can be converted into cash "on demand"
	- Before the 1980s, only commercial banks could legally provide demand deposits. 
	- However, the law changed with the passage of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980. 
	- Today, checking accounts are available from many different financial institutions, such as savings and loan associations, credit unions, and mutual savings banks. 
		- For example, many people hold deposits in negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts or automatic transfer of savings (ATS) accounts, which serve as interest-bearing checking accounts. 
		- NOW and ATS accounts permit depositors to spend their deposits without a trip to the bank to withdraw funds. 
#### M2: Adding Near Monies to M1
- **M2** - definition of the money supply that equals M1 plus near monies, such as savings deposits and small time deposits of less than $100,000.
	- Many economists consider M1 to be too narrow because it doesn't include near money accounts that can be used to purchase goods and services
		- include passbook savings accounts, money market accounts, mutual fund accounts, and time deposits of less than $100,000
$$
\text{M2}=\text{M1}+\text{near monies}=\text{M1}+\text{saving deposits}+\text{small time deposits}<\$100,000
$$
- **Savings deposits** - interest-bearing accounts that can be easily withdrawn
	- include passbook savings accounts, money market accounts, mutual fund accounts, and other types of interest-bearing deposits held at commercial banks, mutual savings banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions. 
- **Time deposit** - an interest-bearing account in a financial institution with guaranteed interest for a specified period of time
	- Certificates of deposit (CDs), for example, are deposits for a specified time, with a penalty charged for early withdrawal
	- Where is the line drawn between a small and a large time deposit? 
		- time deposits of less than $100,000 are “small” and, therefore, are included in M2. In 2020, 3 percent of M2 was small time deposits.

### What a Federal Reserve Bank Does
- **Controlling the money supply**
	- primary role
	- has three policy tools it can use to change the stock of money in the banking system
- **Clearing checks**
	- ensuring money is withdrawn from banks across state lines
- **Supervising and regulating banks**
	- examines banks' books, sets limits for loans, approves bank mergers, and works with the Federal Deposit Insurance Company
	- **Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)** - government agency established in 1933 to insure customer deposits up to a limit if a bank fails
	- If the government provides a safety net, people are less likely to panic and withdraw their funds from banks during a period of economic uncertainty. 
		- When deposits are insured and a bank fails, the government stands ready to pay depositors or transfer their deposits to a solvent bank. 
		- Banks that are members of the Fed are members of the FDIC
		- in 2008, the $700 billion U.S. financial industry rescue law (entitled the Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP) raised the FDIC coverage of bank deposits to $250,000 per customer from $100,000.
- **Maintaining and circulating currency**
	-  Fed does ***not*** print currency—it maintains and circulates money
		- All Federal Reserve notes are printed at the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing’s facilities in Washington, D.C., and Fort Worth, Texas. 
		- The Treasury mints and issues all coins. Coins are made at U.S. mints located in Philadelphia and Denver. 
		- The bureau and the mints ship new notes and coins to the Federal Reserve Banks for circulation. 
	- Much of this money is printed or minted simply to replace worn-out bills and coins. 
	- Another use of new currency is to meet public demand. 
- **Protecting customers**
	- **Equal Credit Opportunity Act** -  prohibits discrimination based on race, color, gender, marital status, religion, or national origin in the extension of credit
		- gives married women the right to establish credit histories in their own names
	- **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)** - independent bureau within the Federal Reserve
		- helps consumers make financial decisions.
		- established in 2010
	- promote fairness and make mortgages, credit cards, and other consumer financial services understandable
- **Maintaining federal government checking accounts and gold**
	- The Fed is also Uncle Sam’s bank
		- The U.S. Treasury has the Fed handle its checking account
		- From this account, the federal government pays for expenses such as federal employees’ salaries, Social Security, tax refunds, veterans’ benefits, defense, and highways
	- New York Federal Reserve District Bank holds one of the oldest forms of money—*gold*
		- belongs mainly to foreign governments and is one of the largest accumulations of this precious metal in the world
		- most cells contain the gold of only one nation
		- when trade occurs between two countries, payment between the parties can be made by transferring gold bars from one compartment to another
- **Lender of last resort**
	- after terrorist attacks of 2001, issued billions in loans to banks
	- in 2008, Fed lent banks enough required to reserve balances
### US Banking Revolution
- Prior to the 1980s, the U.S. banking system was simpler
- consisted of many commercial banks authorized by law to offer checking accounts
- other financial institutions, the so-called thrifts, which included S&Ls, mutual savings banks, and credit unions. 
	- thrifts, by law, were permitted to accept only savings deposits with no checking privileges
	- commercial banks, on the other hand, could not pay interest on checkable deposits. 
	- “maximum interest rate allowed by law” limited competition among commercial banks and other financial institutions. 
#### Money Control Act of 1980
- **Money Control Act** - law, formally titled the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, that gave the Federal Reserve System greater control over nonmember banks and made all financial institutions more competitive
- four major provisions:
	1. *The authority of the Fed over nonmember depository institutions was increased.* 
		- Before the Monetary Control Act, less than half the banks in the United States were members of the Fed and subject to its direct control. 
		- Under the act’s provisions, the Federal Reserve sets uniform reserve requirements for all commercial banks, including state and national banks, S&Ls, and credit unions with checking accounts.
	2. *All depository institutions are able to borrow loan reserves from Federal Reserve banks.* 
		- This practice, called *discounting*, will be explained in the next chapter. Banks also have access to check clearing and other services of the Fed.
	3. *The act allows commercial banks, thrifts, money market mutual funds, stock brokerage firms, and retailers to offer a wide variety of banking services.* 
		- For example, commercial banks and other financial institutions can pay unrestricted interest rates on checking accounts. 
		- Also, S&Ls and other financial institutions can offer checking accounts. 
		- Federal credit unions are authorized to make residential real estate loans, and other major corporations can offer traditional banking services. 
	4. *The act eliminated all interest rate ceilings.* 
		1. Before this act, S&Ls were allowed to pay depositors a slightly higher interest rate on passbook savings deposits than those paid by commercial banks. 
		2. The Monetary Control Act removed this advantage of S&Ls over other financial institutions competing for depositors.
