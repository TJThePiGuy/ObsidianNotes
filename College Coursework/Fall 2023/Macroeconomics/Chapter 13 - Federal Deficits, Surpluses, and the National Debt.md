### Federal Budget Balancing Act
- federal budget deficit occurs whenever the government spends more than it collects in taxes
- accumulation of these budget deficits over the years is the origin of the national debt
#### Federal Budgetary Process
- "battle of the budget” on Capitol Hill involves political decisions on how much the government plans to spend and where the money will come from to finance these outlays
- Wrangling takes place between all sorts of camps:
	- the president versus Congress
	- Republicans versus Democrats
	- national security versus economic equality
	- price stability versus full employment
	- health care versus tax cuts

##### Federal Budgetary Process
1. President must submit budget to Congress on or before the first Monday in February each year
	- official title is *The Budget of the United States*
2. Congress takes lead in budgetary process
	- President's budget becomes starting point for congressional consideration
	- Congressional Budget Office (CBO) employs professional staff who advices Congress on the budget
		- Similar to how the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) advises the president
	- CBO analyzes budget by February and reports evaluation at budget committee hearings in both the House and Senate
	- After debate in May, Congress approves overall budget outline called *budget resolution*
		- sets target levels for spending, tax revenues, and budget deficit/surplus
3. Throughout summer and supposedly ending by October 1, Congress and the president debate while congressional committees and subcommittees prepare to specific spending and tax law bills
	- budget resolution is supposed to guide sending and revenue decisions of these committees
	- after Congress passes and the president signs the spending and revenue budget package, the federal government has its actual budget for spending and tax collection
- The budget bills are not always passed on time, and when that happens, the fiscal year starts without a budget. 
	- Then, federal agencies must operate on the basis of *continuing resolutions*, which means that each agency operates as it did the previous year until the spending bills are approved. 
	- In some years, Congress even fails to pass a continuing resolution, and the federal government must shut down and government workers stay home until Congress approves the necessary funds. 

#### Financing the National Debt
- budget deficit occurs when federal expenditures, including spending for final goods plus transfer payments, exceed tax revenues collected
- budget surplus occurs when the government collects more in taxes than it spends.

- The U.S. Treasury borrows by selling Treasury bills (T-bills), notes, and bonds, promising to make specified interest payments to the buyers of these U.S. government securities and to repay the borrowed funds on a given date.
- considered a safe haven for idle funds and are purchased by Federal Reserve banks, government agencies, private banks, corporations, individual U.S. citizens, and foreigners
	- **National debt** - the total amount owed by the federal government to owners of government securities
		- national debt does not include state and local governments’ debt
		- does include U.S. Treasury securities purchased by various federal agencies, such as the Social Security trust fund
		- federal budget deficits would be significantly higher, or budget surpluses would be significantly lower, without federal government borrowing from this trust fund
	- **Net public debt** - national debt minus all government interagency borrowing

#### Debt Ceiling
- **Debt ceiling** - legislated legal limit on national debt
	- fed cannot legally allow budget deficit to raise the national debt beyond the ceiling
	- like credit limit on credit card
	- when the budget pushes against the debt ceiling, the fed simply raises its own ceiling to accommodate the budget deficit
	- raising the debt ceiling often provokes a fiery political debate over government spending
		- on the other hand, failure to raise the debt ceiling means no money for the government to pay its bills, meet its payroll, or pay interest due on the national debt, which would effectively result in the U.S. government defaulting on its debt
	- Since 1976, the U.S. federal government has shut down over budget issues on 21 occasions

### Why Worry over the National Debt?
- What are some major causes of the rising national debt? 
	- In wartime, the government must increase military expenditures sharply and escalate the national debt. 
	- Recessions also cause the national debt to rise dramatically. 
	- Cyclical downturns such as the 1930s, 1974–1975, 1981–1982, 1990–1991, 2001, and the 2007–2009 “Great Recession,” caused the debt to rise rapidly 
		- decline in real GDP automatically increases the budget deficit due to lower tax collections and greater spending for unemployment compensation and welfare
		- during the Great Recession, the federal government financed bailouts and stimulus spending to boost troubled credit markets by borrowing

#### Can Uncle Sam Go Bankrupt?
##### Reasons to Worry
- If households and firms persistently operate in the red, as the federal government does, they will go bankrupt sooner or later. 
- How long can a national debt continue to rise before the U.S. government is broke? 
- Those who view government debt as being similar to privately held debt are concerned that government debt may be fast approaching a level that could result in government being unable to repay its debt. 
##### Reasons to Not Worry
- GDP is essentially equivalent to our national income. 
- Debt grew considerably slower than GDP between 1945 and 1980. Since 1980, however, the trend reversed, and the debt has grown faster than GDP. 
- The United States was not bankrupt in 1946 nor did it go bankrupt in 2020 when the ratio was even higher.
- Uncle Sam never has to pay off the national debt!

#### Are We Passing the Debt Burden to Our Children?
##### Reasons to Worry
- The fear is that interest payments to finance the national debt will swallow an enormous helping of the federal government’s budget pie. 
- This means future generations will pay more of their tax dollars to the government’s creditors and have less to spend for high-ways, health care, defense, and other public-sector programs. 
- The net interest payment was only 1.7 percent of GDP right after World War II in 1950, but it increased dramatically after the mid-1970s to more than 3 percent in 1995. 
- Since 1995, the interest payment burden declined to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2015 and increased to 1.7 percent in 2020.

##### Reasons to Not Worry
- Stated more precisely, the burden of the debt depends on whether it is held internally or externally
- Bulk of the public debt is internal national debt
	- **Internal national debt** - the portion of the national debt owed to a nation’s own citizens
	- viewed as “we owe it to ourselves"
	- Although this redistribution of income and wealth does indeed favor bondholders, who are typically upper-income individuals, transferring dollars between U.S. citizens does not alter the overall purchasing power in the U.S. economy
- also concede that an external national debt is a concern
	- **External national debt** - the portion of the national debt owed to foreign citizens
	- Financing the external national debt means interest and principal payments are transfers of money from U.S. citizens to other nations. 
	- If foreign governments, banks, corporations, and individual investors hold part of the national debt, the “we owe it to ourselves” argument is weakened.
- If we do not need to worry about shifting the burden to future generations, can the current generation escape the debt burden? The answer is **No**

#### Does Government Borrowing Crowd Out Private-Sector Spending? 
##### Reasons to Worry
- the crowding-out effect dampens the stimulus to aggregate demand from increased federal government spending or cuts in taxes
	- **Crowding-out effect** - reduction in private-sector spending as a result of higher interest rates caused by U.S. Treasury borrowing (selling securities) to finance government deficits
	- suppose the federal government spends and borrows, rather than collecting taxes, to finance new health care programs
		- size of the national debt rises, and interest rates are pushed up in loan markets
		- interest rates rise because the federal government competes with private borrowers for available savings, and less credit is available to consumers and business borrowers. 
		- The result of this crowding-out effect is lower consumption spending ($-\Delta C$) and business investment spending ($-\Delta I$) , which offsets at least some of the boost in aggregate demand ($\Delta AD$) from increased government spending ($\Delta G$), operating through the spending multiplier. It is important to note that the same crowding-out effect could occur if government reduced taxes and did not pay for the tax cuts by reducing its spending. Again, the resulting deficit would have to be financed by government borrowing. 
	- contradicts the theory, explained in the previous Reasons Not to Worry section, that future generations do not bear some of today’s debt burden
		- If federal borrowing crowds out private investment in plants and equipment, future generations will have a smaller possible productive capacity.
##### Reasons to Not Worry
- Keynesian economists counter critics by saying that any crowding-out effect is small or nonexistent. 
	- Instead, at below full-employment real GDP, their counterargument is the crowding-in effect 
	- **Crowding-in effect** -  increase in private sector spending as a result of federal budget deficits financed by U.S. Treasury borrowing. 
		- At less than full employment, consumers hold more Treasury securities, and this additional wealth causes them to spend more. 
		- Business investment spending increases because of optimistic profit expectations
	- government capital spending for highways, dams, universities, and infrastructure financed by borrowing might offset, or more than offset any decline in private investment
- consumers and businesspersons may believe that federal spending is “just what the doctor ordered” for an ailing economy
- Finally, both sides of the debate agree that complete crowding out occurs in one situation. 
	- Suppose the economy is operating at full employment. 
		- This is comparable to being on the economy’s production possibilities curve. 
	- If the government shifts the aggregate demand curve rightward by increasing spending or cutting taxes, the result will be higher prices and a replacement of private-sector output with public-sector output.
