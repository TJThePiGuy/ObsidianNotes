### Business-Cycle Roller Coaster
- **Business cycle** - alternating periods of economic expansion and contraction, which can be measured by changes in real GDP
    - Four phases:
        - **Peak** - phase in which real GDP reaches maximum after rising during recovery
            - Economy is close to / at full employment
        - **Recession** - downturn in business cycle
            - Real GDP declines, business sales and profits fall, percentage of workforce without jobs rises, production capacity is underutilized
            - Consists of two quarters (6 months) in which there is a decline in real GDP
        - **Trough** - phase in which level of real GDP “bottoms out” after a recession
        - **Expansion** - upturn in business cycle during which real GDP rises
            - Sales and profits improve, real GDP rises, employment moves towards full employment
- Over time, long-term upward trend
- **Economic growth** - expansion in national output measured by the annual percentage increase in a nation’s real GDP
- **Leading indicators** - variables that change before real GDP changes
- **Coincident indicators** - variables that change at the same time real GDP changes
- **Lagging indicators** - variables that change after real GDP changes
### Unemployment
- **Unemployment rate** - percentage of people in civilian labor force who are without jobs and are actively seeking jobs
- **Civilian labor force** - number of people 16 years and older who are either employed or unemployed, excluding:
    - Members of the armed forces
    - Homemakers
    - Discouraged workers
    - “Persons not in labor force”
- **Discouraged worker** - person who wants to work, but has given up searching for work because they believe there will be no job offers

$$
\text{Unemployment rate}=\dfrac{\text{unemployed}}{\text{civilian labor force}}\cdot100
$$

- **Frictional unemployment** - temporary unemployment caused by time required for workers to move from one job to another
    - Caused by normal search time required by workers with marketable skills who are changing jobs.
- **Structural unemployment** - unemployment caused by mismatch of of skills of workers who are out of work and the skills required for existing job opportunities
    - 4 Major Causes
        - Lack of Education
        - Changes in Consumer Demand
        - Technological Advances
        - Globalization
            - **Outsourcing** - practice of a company having its work done by another company in another country
            - **Offshoring** - practice when a US company hires employees from another country to perform jobs once done by the company’s American employees
- **Cyclical unemployment** - unemployment caused by lack of jobs in a recession
- **Full employment rate** - situation in which an economy operates at an unemployment rate equal to the sum of the frictional and structural employment rates
- **GDP gap** - difference between actual real GDP and full-employment real GDP
    - Measures cost of cyclical unemployment
    - Positive GDP gap measures a boom in the economy when workers are employed overtime
    - Negative GDP gap increases during a recession
### Meaning and Measurement of Inflation
- **Inflation** *******-******* increase in the general (average) price level of goods and services in the economy
- **Deflation** - decrease in the general (average) price level of goods and services in the economy
- **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** - an index that measures changes in the average prices of consumer goods and services.
    - Also called **cost-of-living** index
 $$
    \text{CPI}=\frac{\text{cost of market basket of products at current-year prices}}{\text{cost of market basket of products at base-year prices}}\cdot100
    $$
$$
    \text{Annual Rate of Inflation} = \frac{\text{CPI in given year }-\text{ CPI in previous year}}{\text{ CPI in previous year}}\cdot100
    $$
#### Criticisms of CPI
- Changes in CPI based on a typical market basket of products that does not match the actual market basket purchased by many consumers
- Difficulty adjusting the CPI for changes in *quality*
- Use of a single base-year market basket ignores the law of demand
### Consequences of Inflation
- **Nominal income** - actual number of dollars received over a period of time (actual salary)
- **Real income** - nominal income *adjusted for change in CPI*
	- If nominal income fails to keep pace with inflation, real income (and standard of living) fall
$$\text{Real income} = \frac{\text{nominal income}}{\text{CPI (as decimal)}}$$
$$\text{Salary in given year} = \text{Salary in previous year} \times \frac{\text{CPI in given year}}{\text{CPI in previous year}}$$
- **Wealth** - value of stock assets owned at some point in time
	- Inflation benefits wealth holders because value of assets tend to increase as prices rise
- **Nominal interest rate** - actual market rate of interest earned over a period of time
- **Real interest rate** - $\text{Nominal Interest Rate}-\text{Inflation Rate}$
- **Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)** - home loan that adjusts the nominal interest rate to changes in an index rate, such as rates on Treasury securities
	- Inflation rises $\rightarrow$ interest rate increases
### Inflation on a Rampage
- **Hyperinflation** - extremely rapid raise in price level (above 100% inflation)
	- individuals and businesses develop an *inflation psychosis*, causing them to buy quickly today in order to avoid paying even more tomorrow
	- jeopardizes debtor–lender contracts, such as credit cards, home mortgages, life insurance policies, pensions, bonds, and other forms of savings
	- **Wage-price spiral** -  situation that occurs when increases in nominal wage rates are passed on in higher prices, which, in turn, result in even higher nominal wage rates and prices
	- people turn to more speculative investments that might yield higher financial returns
	- result of a government’s ill-advised decision to increase a country’s money supply too much
- **Disinflation** - decrease in the rate of inflation
### Demand-Pull and Cost-Push Inflation
- **Demand-pull inflation** - rise in the general price level resulting from an excess of total spending (demand)
	- illustrated by a rightward shift of the aggregate demand curve
	- “too much money chasing too few goods.”
- **Cost-push inflation** - increase in the general price level resulting from an increase in the cost of production
	- upward pressure on prices can be caused by cost increases for labor, raw materials, construction, equipment, borrowing
**John Maynard Keynes** - British economist (1883–1946) whose influential work offered an explanation of the Great Depression and suggested, as a cure, that the government should play an active role in the economy
### Classical Theory and the Keynesian Revolution
- **Classical economists** - group of economists whose theory dominated economic thinking from the 1770s to the Great Depression
	- believed recessions would naturally cure themselves because the price system would automatically restore full employment.
	- flexible prices (including flexible wages and interest rates) in competitive markets bring all markets to full-employment equilibrium
	- **Say's Law** - supply creates its own demand
		- long-term underspending is impossible because the production of goods and services generates an equal amount of total spending for these goods and services
	- unemployment is only temporary as wages and prices decline, or is the result of people who voluntarily choose not to work at lower wages
	- there is a natural tendency for the economy to restore full employment over time. 
- **Keynes's Theory** - demand creates its own supply
	- aggregate expenditures determine real GDP, employment, and income
- **Consumption function** - graph or table that shows the amount households spend for goods and services at different levels of real disposable income
	- Slope is **marginal propensity to consume (MPC)** - change in consumption resulting from a given change in real disposable income $$\text{MPC}=\frac{\Delta \text{ real consumption}}{\Delta \text{ real disposable income}}=\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y_{d}}$$
	- Y-intercept is **Autonomous consumption** - consumption that is independent of the level of real disposable income
- **Dissaving** - amount by which real personal consumption expenditures exceed real disposable income
	- vertical distance below the consumption function to the *45-degree line*
- **Saving** - part of disposable income households **do not spend** for consumer goods and services
	- vertical distance above the consumption function to the *45-degree line*
- **Marginal propensity to save (MPS)** - change in saving resulting from a given change in real disposable income
- $$\text{MPS}=1-\text{MPC}=\frac{\Delta \text{ saving}}{\Delta \text{ real disposable income}}=\frac{\Delta S}{\Delta Y_{d}}$$
### Reasons the Consumption Function Shifts
- **Non-income factors** cause consumption function to shift
	- Consumer expectations (future inflation rate, likelihood of unemployment, likelihood of higher income) can shift curve
		- Optimistic expectations shift curve upward, Pessimistic expectations shift curve downward
	- More wealth $\to$ more spending $\to$ upward shift of consumption function
		- **Wealth effect** - shift in the consumption function caused by a change in the value of real and financial assets
	- Change in purchasing power of financial assets with fixed nominal value can shift consumption function
		- Raise in price level $\to$ decrease in real wealth $\to$ shift downward
	- Interest rates fall $\to$ upward shift of curve
### Investment Expenditures
- Keynes argued expectations of future profits are primary factor in determining investment
- **Investment demand curve** - curve that shows the amount businesses spend for investment goods at different possible rates of interest
	- changes in the interest rate generate movements along investment demand curve
	- factors that changes expected rate of profit shifts the investment demand curve $\to$ changes the investment spending component of aggregate expenditures
		- Expectations, technological change, capacity utilization, business taxes shift curve
- *Businesses will undertake all planned investment projects for which the expected rate of profit exceeds or equals the interest rate.*
- **Autonomous Expenditure** - spending that does not vary with the level of real disposable income
		- remain a fixed amount, regardless of the level of disposable income
### Aggregate Expenditures Model
- **Aggregate Expenditures Function (AE)** - total spending in an economy at different levels of real GDP $$\text{AE}=C+I+G+(X-M)$$
	- Calculated by vertically summing $C+I+G+(X-M)$ at each level of real GDP on the horizontal axis
	- Slope is **MPC**
	- y-intercept is $\text{Autonomous Consumption}+I+G+(X-M)$
	- **Macro-equilibrium** established at point $E$ where aggregate expenditures equal real GDP along the *45 degree line*
- Aggregate expenditures in **Keynesian** economics pull aggregate output either **higher** or **lower** toward equilibrium in the economy, as opposed to the *classical* view that aggregate output generates *an equal amount* of aggregate spending. 
- **Aggregate Expenditures Model** - model that determines the equilibrium level of real GDP by the intersection of the aggregate expenditures and aggregate output and income (real GDP) curves
	- Each point reflects possible equilibrium between real GDP aggregate output ($Y$) and aggregate expenditures ($AE$)
	- **Inventory accumulation** - vertical distance above businesses' output level and below equilibrium GDP
	- **Inventory depletion** - vertical distance below businesses' output level and above equilibrium GDP
### Spending Multipliers Effect
- **Spending multiplier (SM)** - ratio of the change in real GDP to an initial change in any component of aggregate expenditures, including consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports$$\begin{align*}
\text{Spending multiplier} &=  \frac{\text{change in equilibrium real GDP}}{\text{initial change in aggregate expenditures}}\\
&= \frac{1}{1-\text{MPC}}=\frac{1}{\text{MPS}}
\end{align*}$$
### Recessionary and Inflationary Gaps
- **Recessionary gap** - amount by which the aggregate expenditures fall short of the amount required to achieve full-employment equilibrium $$\Delta \text{ Autonomous Expenditures}\times \text{Spending Multiplier}=\Delta \text{ Equilibrium Output}$$
- **Tax multiplier** - change in aggregate expenditures (total spending) resulting from an initial change in taxes $$\begin{gather*}
\text{Tax Multiplier}=1-\text{Spending Multiplier}\\\Delta T\times \text{Tax Multiplier}=\Delta \text{ Real GDP}
\end{gather*}$$
- **Inflationary gap** - amount by which the aggregate expenditures exceed the amount required to achieve full-employment equilibrium
### Aggregate Demand Curve
- **Aggregate demand curve (AD)** - curve that shows the level of real GDP purchased by households, businesses, government, and foreigners (net exports) at different possible price levels during a time period, ceteris paribus
	- Inverse relationship between real GDP and price level
- **Real balances effect** - impact on total spending (real GDP) caused by inverse relationship between price level and real value of financial assets with fixed nominal value
- **Interest-rate effect** - impact on total spending (real GDP) caused by direct relationship between price level and interest rate
- **Net exports effect** - impact on total spending (real GDP) caused by inverse relationship between price level and net exports of economy
  
| Effect | Causation Chain |
| :---: |:---:|
| Real balances effect | Price level decreases $\to$ Purchasing power rises $\to$ Wealth rises $\to$ Consumers buy more goods $\to$ Quantity of real GDP increases |
| Interest-rate effect | Price level decreases $\to$ Purchasing power rises $\to$ Demand for fixed supply of credit falls $\to$ Interest rates fall $\to$ Businesses and households borrow and buy more goods $\to$ Quantity of real GDP demanded increases |
| Net exports effect | Price level decreases $\to$ US goods become less expensive than foreign goods $\to$ Americans and foreigners buy more US goods $\to$ Exports rise and Imports fall $\to$ Quality of real GDP demanded increases |

- Anything that increases aggregate expenditures \[$C, I, G, (X-M)$\] shift AD curve **rightward**. Anything decreasing spending shifts AD curve **leftward**
### Aggregate Supply Curve
- **Aggregate supply curve (AS)** - curve that shows the level of real GDP produced at different possible price levels during a time period, ceteris paribus
	- When the aggregate supply curve is horizontal and an economy is in recession below full employment, the only effects of an increase in aggregate demand are increases in real GDP and employment, while the price level does not change. Stated simply, the Keynesian view is that “demand creates its own supply.”
	- When the aggregate supply curve is vertical at the full-employment GDP, the only effect over time of a change in aggregate demand is a change in the price level. Stated simply, the classical view is that “supply creates its own demand.”
##### Ranges of Aggregate Supply Curve
- **Keynesian range** - horizontal segment of the aggregate supply curve, which represents an economy in a severe recession
	- below real GDP $Y_{K}$ , which is much lover than full employment output $Y_{F}$
	- Even if AD curve shifts, equilibrium real GDP changes, but price level fixed
- **Intermediate range** - rising segment of the aggregate supply curve, which represents an economy as it approaches full-employment output
	- between $Y_{K}$ and $Y_{F}$
	- as aggregate demand increases in the Keynesian range, the price level remains constant as real GDP expands
- **Classical range** - vertical segment of the aggregate supply curve, which represents an economy at full-employment output
	- real GDP is at $Y_{F}$
	- once the economy reaches full-employment output in the classical range, additional increases in aggregate demand merely cause inflation, rather than more real GDP
- **GDP Gap on AS curve** - horizontal distance between full employment real GDP and equilibrium real GDP

Nonprice-Level Determinants of Aggregate Demand (total spending) | Nonprice-Level Determinants of Aggregate Supply

- **Stagflation** - condition that occurs when an economy experiences the twin maladies of high unemployment and rapid inflation simultaneously
	- Leftward shift in aggregate supply curve can cause **Cost-push inflation**
	- Rightward shift in aggregate demand curve can cause **Demand-pull inflation**
