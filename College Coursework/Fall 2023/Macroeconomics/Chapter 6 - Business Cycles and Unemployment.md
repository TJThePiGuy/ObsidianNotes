### Business-Cycle Roller Coaster
- **Business cycle** - alternating periods of economic expansion and contraction, which can be measured by changes in real GDP
    - Four phases:
        - **Peak** - phase in which real GDP reaches maximum after rising during recovery
            - Economy is close to / at full employment
        - **Recession** - downturn in business cycle
            - Real GDP declines, business sales and profits fall, percentage of workforce without jobs rises, production capacity is underutilized
            - Consists of two quarters (6 months) in which there is a decline in real GDP
        - **Trough** - phase in which level of real GDP “bottoms out” after a recession
        - **Expansion** - upturn in business cycle during which real GDP rises
            - Sales and profits improve, real GDP rises, employment moves towards full employment
- Over time, long-term upward trend
- **Economic growth** - expansion in national output measured by the annual percentage increase in a nation’s real GDP
- **Leading indicators** - variables that change before real GDP changes
- **Coincident indicators** - variables that change at the same time real GDP changes
- **Lagging indicators** - variables that change after real GDP changes
### Unemployment
- **Unemployment rate** - percentage of people in civilian labor force who are without jobs and are actively seeking jobs
- **Civilian labor force** - number of people 16 years and older who are either employed or unemployed, excluding:
    - Members of the armed forces
    - Homemakers
    - Discouraged workers
    - “Persons not in labor force”
- **Discouraged worker** - person who wants to work, but has given up searching for work because they believe there will be no job offers

$$
\text{Unemployment rate}=\dfrac{\text{unemployed}}{\text{civilian labor force}}\cdot100
$$

- **Frictional unemployment** - temporary unemployment caused by time required for workers to move from one job to another
    - Caused by normal search time required by workers with marketable skills who are changing jobs.
- **Structural unemployment** - unemployment caused by mismatch of of skills of workers who are out of work and the skills required for existing job opportunities
    - 4 Major Causes
        - Lack of Education
        - Changes in Consumer Demand
        - Technological Advances
        - Globalization
            - **Outsourcing** - practice of a company having its work done by another company in another country
            - **Offshoring** - practice when a US company hires employees from another country to perform jobs once done by the company’s American employees
- **Cyclical unemployment** - unemployment caused by lack of jobs in a recession
- **Full employment rate** - situation in which an economy operates at an unemployment rate equal to the sum of the frictional and structural employment rates
- **GDP gap** - difference between actual real GDP and full-employment real GDP
    - Measures cost of cyclical unemployment
    - Positive GDP gap measures a boom in the economy when workers are employed overtime
    - Negative GDP gap increases during a recession
