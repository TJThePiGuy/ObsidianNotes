### Aggregate Expenditures Model
- **Aggregate Expenditures Function (AE)** - total spending in an economy at different levels of real GDP $$\text{AE}=C+I+G+(X-M)$$
	- Calculated by vertically summing $C+I+G+(X-M)$ at each level of real GDP on the horizontal axis
	- Slope is **MPC**
	- y-intercept is $\text{Autonomous Consumption}+I+G+(X-M)$
	- **Macro-equilibrium** established at point $E$ where aggregate expenditures equal real GDP along the *45 degree line*
- Aggregate expenditures in **Keynesian** economics pull aggregate output either **higher** or **lower** toward equilibrium in the economy, as opposed to the *classical* view that aggregate output generates *an equal amount* of aggregate spending. 
- **Aggregate Expenditures Model** - model that determines the equilibrium level of real GDP by the intersection of the aggregate expenditures and aggregate output and income (real GDP) curves
	- Each point reflects possible equilibrium between real GDP aggregate output ($Y$) and aggregate expenditures ($AE$)
	- **Inventory accumulation** - vertical distance above businesses' output level and below equilibrium GDP
	- **Inventory depletion** - vertical distance below businesses' output level and above equilibrium GDP
### Spending Multipliers Effect
- **Spending multiplier (SM)** - ratio of the change in real GDP to an initial change in any component of aggregate expenditures, including consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports$$\begin{align*}
\text{Spending multiplier} &=  \frac{\text{change in equilibrium real GDP}}{\text{initial change in aggregate expenditures}}\\
&= \frac{1}{1-\text{MPC}}=\frac{1}{\text{MPS}}
\end{align*}$$
### Recessionary and Inflationary Gaps
- **Recessionary gap** - amount by which the aggregate expenditures fall short of the amount required to achieve full-employment equilibrium $$\Delta \text{ Autonomous Expenditures}\times \text{Spending Multiplier}=\Delta \text{ Equilibrium Output}$$
- **Tax multiplier** - change in aggregate expenditures (total spending) resulting from an initial change in taxes $$\begin{gather*}
\text{Tax Multiplier}=1-\text{Spending Multiplier}\\\Delta T\times \text{Tax Multiplier}=\Delta \text{ Real GDP}
\end{gather*}$$
- **Inflationary gap** - amount by which the aggregate expenditures exceed the amount required to achieve full-employment equilibrium
