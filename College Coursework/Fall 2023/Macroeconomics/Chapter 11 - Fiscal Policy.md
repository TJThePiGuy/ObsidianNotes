### Discretionary Fiscal Policy
- **Discretionary fiscal policy** - deliberate use of changes in government spending or taxes to alter aggregate demand and stabilize the economy

| Expansionary Fiscal Policy | Contractionary Fiscal Policy |
| :---: |:---:|
| Increase government spending | Decrease government spending |
| Decrease taxes | Increase taxes |
| Increase government spending and taxes equally | Decrease government spending and taxes equally |

#### Increasing Government Spending to Combat a Recession
- **Spending multiplier (SM)** - change in aggregate demand resulting from initial change in component of aggregate demand ($C,I,G,NX$)
$$
\Delta G \times \text{SM} = \Delta \text{ aggregate demand (total spending)}
$$
- Increase in aggregate demand shifts AD curve right, moving up along AS curve
	- Decrease in aggregate demand shifts AD curve left, moving down along AS curve
- In the intermediate segment of the aggregate supply curve, the required increase in government spending to achieve full employment will be smaller than the required increase in aggregate demand because of the spending multiplier

#### Spending Multiplier Arithmetic Revisited
- **Marginal propensity to consume (MPC)** - change in consumption spending resulting from given change in income
$$
\text{MPC} = \frac{\text{change in consumption spending}}{\text{change in income}}
$$
- **Marginal propensity to save (MPS)** - change in saving resulting from given change in income
$$
\text{MPC}+\text{MPS}=1
$$
$$
\text{SM}=\frac{1}{1-\text{MPC}}=\frac{1}{\text{MPS}}
$$

#### Cutting Taxes to Combat a Recession
- **Tax multiplier (TM)** - change in aggregate demand resulting form an initial change in taxes
$$
\text{TM}=1-\text{SM}
$$
$$
\Delta T\times TM=\Delta AD\text{ (aggregate demand)}
$$

#### Expansionary Fiscal Policy Can Create a Fiscal Deficit
- **Budget deficit (fiscal deficit)** -  budget in which government expenditures exceed government revenues in a given time 
	- Add to nation's debt
	- When government spends more money than it collects as taxes, it will have to borrow the difference
	- Keynesian economics recommends running a fiscal deficit as a viable option to combat a recession

#### Using Fiscal Policy to Combat Inflation
- When operating at full employment, any increase in AD causes inflation, without change to GDP
- By cutting government spending/increasing taxes, AD curve shifts left, decreasing inflation while keeping full-employment output

#### Contractionary Fiscal Policy Can Create a Fiscal Surplus
- **Budget surplus (fiscal surplus)** - amount by which government revenues exceed government expenditures in a given time period
	- Can be used to pay off nation's debt
	- Keynesian economics recommends running a fiscal surplus as a viable option to combat inflation

#### The Balanced Budget Multiplier
- **Balanced budget multiplier** - equal change in government spending and taxes, which changes aggregate demand by the amount of the change in government spending
$$
\Delta AD=\Delta G\times \text{SM}+\Delta T\times \text{TM}
$$

### Automatic Stabilizers
- **Automatic stabilizers** - federal expenditures and tax revenues that automatically change and stabilize an economic expansion of contraction
	- Referred to as *nondiscretionary fiscal policy* because no deliberate action is undertaken by government to change spending or taxes
	-  “leans against the prevailing wind”
	- Automatic stabilizers assist in offsetting a recession when real GDP falls and in offsetting inflation when real GDP expands

### Supply-Side Fiscal Policy
- **Supply-side fiscal policy** - fiscal policy that emphasizes government policies that increase aggregate supply in order to achieve long-run growth in real output, full employment, and a lower price level

#### Keynesian Demand-Side vs. Supply-Side Fiscal Policy
- Demand-side fiscal policy - higher government spending/lower taxes increase aggregate demand
	- Increases real GDP, but also increases price level
	- Demand-pull inflation experienced
- Supply-side fiscal policy - federal government should shift aggregate supply curve rightward
	- Increases real GDP and decreases price level

#### Supply-Side Fiscal Policy Effects on the Labor Market 
- both Keynesians and supply-siders agree that tax cuts increase disposable personal income
	- supply-side economists argue instead that changes in disposable income affect the incentive for people to work, to save, and to invest
	- when the tax rates are cut, supply-side theory predicts the labor supply curve will shift rightward and establish a new equilibrium
		- increase in the after-tax wage rate gives workers the incentive to work more hours per year
		- those in the labor force will want to work more hours and take fewer vacations.
		- as a result of the increase in the labor supply curve, the price of labor falls and the equilibrium number of labor hours increases
		- Low labor costs increase aggregate supply
	- tax cuts of the early 1980s also provided tax breaks that subsidized business investment
		-  increase the nation’s productive capacity by increasing the quantity and quality of capital
		- aggregate supply curve would shift rightward because businesses have an extra after-tax profit incentive to invest and produce more at each price level
- **critics refer to supply-side economics as “trickle-down economics”**
	- Keynesians argue that the magnitude of any rightward shift in aggregate supply is likely to be small and occurs only in the long run
		- it takes many years before tax cuts for business generate any change in actual plants and equipment or technological advances
		- unless a reduction in government spending offsets the tax cuts, the effect will be a Keynesian increase in the aggregate demand curve and a higher price level
