### Meaning and Measurement of Inflation
- **Inflation** *******-******* increase in the general (average) price level of goods and services in the economy
- **Deflation** - decrease in the general (average) price level of goods and services in the economy
- **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** - an index that measures changes in the average prices of consumer goods and services.
    - Also called **cost-of-living** index
 $$
    \text{CPI}=\frac{\text{cost of market basket of products at current-year prices}}{\text{cost of market basket of products at base-year prices}}\cdot100
    $$
$$
    \text{Annual Rate of Inflation} = \frac{\text{CPI in given year }-\text{ CPI in previous year}}{\text{ CPI in previous year}}\cdot100
    $$
#### Criticisms of CPI
- Changes in CPI based on a typical market basket of products that does not match the actual market basket purchased by many consumers
- Difficulty adjusting the CPI for changes in *quality*
- Use of a single base-year market basket ignores the law of demand
### Consequences of Inflation
- **Nominal income** - actual number of dollars received over a period of time (actual salary)
- **Real income** - nominal income *adjusted for change in CPI*
	- If nominal income fails to keep pace with inflation, real income (and standard of living) fall
$$\text{Real income} = \frac{\text{nominal income}}{\text{CPI (as decimal)}}$$
$$\text{Salary in given year} = \text{Salary in previous year} \times \frac{\text{CPI in given year}}{\text{CPI in previous year}}$$
- **Wealth** - value of stock assets owned at some point in time
	- Inflation benefits wealth holders because value of assets tend to increase as prices rise
- **Nominal interest rate** - actual market rate of interest earned over a period of time
- **Real interest rate** - $\text{Nominal Interest Rate}-\text{Inflation Rate}$
- **Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)** - home loan that adjusts the nominal interest rate to changes in an index rate, such as rates on Treasury securities
	- Inflation rises $\rightarrow$ interest rate increases
### Inflation on a Rampage
- **Hyperinflation** - extremely rapid raise in price level (above 100% inflation)
	- individuals and businesses develop an *inflation psychosis*, causing them to buy quickly today in order to avoid paying even more tomorrow
	- jeopardizes debtor–lender contracts, such as credit cards, home mortgages, life insurance policies, pensions, bonds, and other forms of savings
	- **Wage-price spiral** -  situation that occurs when increases in nominal wage rates are passed on in higher prices, which, in turn, result in even higher nominal wage rates and prices
	- people turn to more speculative investments that might yield higher financial returns
	- result of a government’s ill-advised decision to increase a country’s money supply too much
### Demand-Pull and Cost-Push Inflation
- **Demand-pull inflation** - rise in the general price level resulting from an excess of total spending (demand)
	- illustrated by a rightward shift of the aggregate demand curve
	- “too much money chasing too few goods.”
- **Cost-push inflation** - increase in the general price level resulting from an increase in the cost of production
	- upward pressure on prices can be caused by cost increases for labor, raw materials, construction, equipment, borrowing
