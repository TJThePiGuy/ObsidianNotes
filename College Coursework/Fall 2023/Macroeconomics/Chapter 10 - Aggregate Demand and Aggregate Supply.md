### Aggregate Demand Curve
- **Aggregate demand curve (AD)** - curve that shows the level of real GDP purchased by households, businesses, government, and foreigners (net exports) at different possible price levels during a time period, ceteris paribus
	- Inverse relationship between real GDP and price level
- **Real balances effect** - impact on total spending (real GDP) caused by inverse relationship between price level and real value of financial assets with fixed nominal value
- **Interest-rate effect** - impact on total spending (real GDP) caused by direct relationship between price level and interest rate
- **Net exports effect** - impact on total spending (real GDP) caused by inverse relationship between price level and net exports of economy
  
| Effect | Causation Chain |
| --- |:---:|
| Real balances effect | Price level decreases $\to$ Purchasing power rises $\to$ Wealth rises $\to$ Consumers buy more goods $\to$ Quantity of real GDP increases |
| Interest-rate effect | Price level decreases $\to$ Purchasing power rises $\to$ Demand for fixed supply of credit falls $\to$ Interest rates fall $\to$ Businesses and households borrow and buy more goods $\to$ Quantity of real GDP demanded increases |
| Net exports effect | Price level decreases $\to$ US goods become less expensive than foreign goods $\to$ Americans and foreigners buy more US goods $\to$ Exports rise and Imports fall $\to$ Quality of real GDP demanded increases |

- Anything that increases aggregate expenditures \[$C, I, G, (X-M)$\] shift AD curve **rightward**. Anything decreasing spending shifts AD curve **leftward**
### Aggregate Supply Curve
- **Aggregate supply curve (AS)** - curve that shows the level of real GDP produced at different possible price levels during a time period, ceteris paribus
	- When the aggregate supply curve is horizontal and an economy is in recession below full employment, the only effects of an increase in aggregate demand are increases in real GDP and employment, while the price level does not change. Stated simply, the Keynesian view is that “demand creates its own supply.”
	- When the aggregate supply curve is vertical at the full-employment GDP, the only effect over time of a change in aggregate demand is a change in the price level. Stated simply, the classical view is that “supply creates its own demand.”
##### Ranges of Aggregate Supply Curve
- **Keynesian range** - horizontal segment of the aggregate supply curve, which represents an economy in a severe recession
	- below real GDP $Y_{K}$ , which is much lover than full employment output $Y_{F}$
	- Even if AD curve shifts, equilibrium real GDP changes, but price level fixed
- **Intermediate range** - rising segment of the aggregate supply curve, which represents an economy as it approaches full-employment output
	- between $Y_{K}$ and $Y_{F}$
	- as aggregate demand increases in the Keynesian range, the price level remains constant as real GDP expands
- **Classical range** - vertical segment of the aggregate supply curve, which represents an economy at full-employment output
	- real GDP is at $Y_{F}$
	- once the economy reaches full-employment output in the classical range, additional increases in aggregate demand merely cause inflation, rather than more real GDP
- **GDP Gap on AS curve** - horizontal distance between full employment real GDP and equilibrium real GDP

- **Stagflation** - condition that occurs when an economy experiences the twin maladies of high unemployment and rapid inflation simultaneously
	- Leftward shift in aggregate supply curve can cause **Cost-push inflation**
	- Rightward shift in aggregate demand curve can cause **Demand-pull inflation**
