### Money Creation Begins
- **Fractional reserve banking** - system in which banks keep only a percentage of their deposits on reserve as vault cash and deposits at the Fed
	- In a 100 percent reserve banking system, banks would be unable to make loans. 
	- However, holding less than 100 percent on reserve allows banks to make loans, and, in turn, these loans add to the money supply. 
	- Because the money supply is increased when banks make loans, we say that banks “create money.” 
#### Banker Bookkeeping
- **Balance sheet** - statement of the assets and liabilities of a bank at a given point in time
	- also called *T-accounts*
	- **Liabilities** - the amounts the bank owes to others
		- checkable deposits
	- **Assets** - amounts the bank owns
		- **Required reserves** - minimum balance of reserves that the Fed requires a bank to hold in vault cash or on deposit with the fed
		- **Required reserve ratio** - percentage of deposits that the Fed requires a banks to hold in vault cash or on deposit with the Fed rather than being loaned
		- **Excess reserves** - potential loan balances held in vault cash or on deposit with the Fed in excess of required reserves$$
\text{Total reserves}=\text{Required reserves}+\text{Excess reserves}
$$
		- **Loans** - interest-earning assets of the bank
			- represent outstanding credit payable to the bank
			- bank uses balances not held in reserves to earn an income

#### Step One: Accepting a New Deposit
- Increase bank's checkable deposits on the liability side by amount deposited
	- liability because they can change their mind and withdraw money
- Add $\text{deposit amount}\times \text{required reserve ratio}$ to required reserves
- Add remainder of deposit to excess reserves
- Transferring currency to a bank and moving deposits from one bank to another do not affect the money supply (M1)
#### Step Two: Making a Loan
- eager to make loans and earn profit by charging interest
- Increase bank's loan amount by amount loaned
- Add loan amount to liabilities
- Must increase required reserves to maintain required reserve ratio - move money from excess to required
- Decrease excess reserves
- When a bank makes a loan, it creates deposits, and the money supply increases by the amount of the loan because the money supply includes checkable deposits. 
#### Step Three: Clearing the Loan Check
- Fed clears check by debiting reserve amount of loaned bank and crediting reserve account of deposited bank
- Reduces account by amount cleared
- Required reserves decreases to preserve required reserve ratio
- Excess reserves decreases by remainder

### Multiplier Expansion of Money by the Banking System
- Although a single bank is limited in its ability to increase the money supply equal to its excess reserves, an entire banking system can increase the money supply by a multiple of its initial excess reserves. 
	- This is because the reserves lost by one bank when a loan is made are gained by another bank in the system. 
#### Money Multiplier
- **Money multiplier** - gives the *maximum* change in the money supply (checkable deposits) due to an initial change in the excess reserves
$$
\text{MM} = \frac{1}{\text{required reserve ratio (RRR)}}
$$
$$
\Delta \text{M1}=\Delta \text{ER (excess reserves)}\times \text{MM}
$$
- In reality, for several reasons, the size of the money multiplier can be considerably smaller than our handy little formula indicates. 
	- any other customer along the money creation process can decide to put a portion of the loan in her pocket rather than writing a check for the full amount of the loan
	- Money outside the banking system in someone’s wallet or purse or underneath the mattress is a cash leakage, which reduces the value of the money multiplier.
- Second, the size of the money multiplier falls when banks do not use all their excess reserves to make loans
	- Perhaps a financial crisis causes many people to lose confidence in the banking system, and they make large deposit account withdrawals. 
	- As a result, banks hold their excess reserves to ensure their liquidity. 
	- Or, some banks can hold excess reserves because they lack enough “worthy” loan applications. 
- If banks decide to hoard reserves, or if the public decides not to spend some of the loans they receive, then the money multiplier will be smaller. 
### How Monetary Policy Creates Money
- **Monetary policy** - Fed's use of open market operations, changes in discount rate, and changes in required reserve ratio to change the money supply (M1)
#### Open Market Operations
- A major liability of the Fed was $2,148 billion worth of Federal Reserve notes—paper currency. 
	- This is in contrast to the major liability of commercial banks, which is checkable deposits
	- the Fed issues, but does not actually print, Federal Reserve notes. 
	- Instead, the Fed decides how much to issue and then calls the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to order new batches of $10, $20, $50, and $100 bills, which the Fed sends to the banks in armored trucks. 
- Another important liability of the Fed is the deposits of banks and the U.S. Treasury totaling $4,525 billion. 
	- The Fed, therefore, serves as a bank for these banks and the Treasury. 
	- Note that these bank deposits include the required reserve deposits discussed at the beginning of the chapter. 
	- Finally, total liabilities and net worth equaled total assets of $8,448 billion.
- The FOMC determines the money supply through open market operations
	- **Open market operations** - the buying and selling of government securities by the Federal Reserve System
