## Chapter 5: Sensation and Perception

### Anatomy of Visual System
1. Light Waves transmitted across cornea and enter through pupil
	1. Pupil size controlled by muscles connected to iris
2. Light crosses the lens and is focused on fovea (part of retina)
	1. Fovea contains photoreceptors
3. Photoreceptors connected to retinal ganglion cells. Axons form cells exit through back of eye where they form optic nerve
4. Optic nerve carries visual information to brain
- **Blind spot** - point of no receptors, where we cannot respond to visual info

### Photoreceptors
- **Cones** - phototopic vision (daytime)
	- Best in bright light
	- High-acuity color info
	- Located in Fovea
- **Rods** - scoptic vision (nighttime)
	- Best in low light
	- Low-acuity vision in dim light
	- Peripheral vision
	- Located in periphery of retina
	  
### Color Vision
- **Trichromatic Theory** - all colors can be produced by combining red, green, blue
	- Applies to retina where color vision is controlled by 3 types of  cones
- **Opponent-Process Theory** - Color is coded in opponent pairs
	- Black & White, Yellow & Blue, Green & Red
	- Some cells excited by one opponent color and inhibited by another
	- Applies to cells **after** retina

**Binocular disparity** - slightly different view of the world that each eye receives

### Gestalt Principles of Perception
- **Gestalt psychology** - field of psych based on idea that whole is different than sum of its parts
	- Brain creates perception more than simply sum of sensory inputs
	- Brain does this in predictable ways
- **Principles of Gestalt Psychology**
		- **Figure-Ground Relationship** - tend to segment visual world into figure (focus of visual field) and ground (background)
		- **Proximity** - things close to one another are grouped together
		- **Similarity** - things alike are grouped together
		- **Continuity** - more likely to perceive continuous lines rather than jagged ones
		- **Closure** - perceive a complete circle rather than series of segments

**Stroop Effect** - different colored text compared to words is harder to read

## Chapter 6 - Learning

### Unlearned Behaviours
- **Reflexes** - motor/neural reactions to specific stimulus
	- Simpler
	- Involve activity of specific body parts
	- Primitive centers of CNS (medulla, spinal cord)
	- Sucking reflex
- **Instincts** - behaviours triggered by broader range of events
	- More complex
	- Involve movement of whole organism (sexual activity, migration)
	- Higher brain centers 

### What is Learning?
- **Learning** - relatively permanent change in behaviour/knowledge that results from experience
	- Involves acquiring skills/knowledge through experience
	- Involves conscious and unconscious processes
- **Associative Learning** - when an organism makes connections between stimuli or events that occur together in an environment

### Classical Conditioning
- **Classical Conditioning** - process by which we learn to associate stimuli and anticipate events
	- Ivan Pavlov's dogs
	- organisms have 2 types of responses: **unconditioned** (unlearned) and **conditioned** (learned)
#### Before Conditioning
- **Unconditioned stimulus (UCS)** - stimulus that elicits reflexive response (food)
- **Unconditioned response (UCR)** - natural unlearned reaction to stimulus (salivating in response to food)
	- Food (UCS) -> Salivation (UCR)
#### During Conditioning
- **Neutral stimulus (NS)** - stimulus that does not naturally elicit a response
	- Ringing of the bell
	- Paired repeatedly with unconditioned stimulus
	- Food (UCS) + Bell (NS) -> Salivation (UCR)
#### After Conditioning
- **Conditioned stimulus (CS)** - stimulus that elicits response after repeatedly paired with unconditioned stimulus
- **Conditioned response (CR)** - behaviour caused by conditioned stimulus
	- Bell (CS) -> Salivation (CR)

**Higher-order conditioning** - established conditioned stimulus paired with new neutral stimulus
- eventually, new stimulus elicits conditioned response without initial unconditioned stimulus


#### General Process in Classical Conditioning
- **Acquisition** - initial period of learning when organism learns to connect NS with UCS
	- Requires short time interval between NS and UCS
	- Requires repeated pairing
- **Extinction** - decrease in CR when UCS no longer present with CS
	- If food stops being presented with sound of bell, eventually dog will stop salivating
- **Spontaneous recovery** - return of previous extinguished conditioned response following rest period

### Distinguishing Between Stimuli
- **Stimulus discrimination** - organism learns to respond differently to various similar stimuli
	- Dog can distinguish between specific bell sound that signals food and other bells that do not signal food
- **Stimulus generalization** - organism demonstrates CR to stimuli similar to CS
	- Disliking specific spider -> disliking all spiders
- **Habituation** - learning not to respond to stimulus that is presented repeatedly without change

### Little Albert Study
- Conducted by John B Watson
- Fucking tortured small child
- Exposed Little Albert to certain stimuli
	1. Presented with neutral stimuli (rabbit, dog, cotton wool) (NS)
	2. Paired with loud sound every time Albert touched stimulus that caused him to fear
	- Loud noise (US) + White fluffy thing (N) -> Fear (UR)
	3. After repeated pairings, Albert feared stimulus
	- White fluffy thing (CS) -> Fear (CR)
- Through stimulus generalization, Little Albert feared all furry things


### Operant Conditioning
- **Operant conditioning** - organisms learn to associate behaviour and consequences
	- Proposed by B.F. Skinner
	- Desired result / Pleasant consequence -> more likely behaviour
	- Undesired result / Unpleasant consequence -> less likely behaviour
- **Positive** - adding something
- **Negative** - removing something
- **Reinforcement** - increasing a behaviour
- **Punishment** - decreasing a behaviour

### Skinner Box
- Skinner placed animals inside box containing a lever
- When pressed, food would be dispensed as reward

### Shaping
- **Shaping** - reward successive approximations of target behaviour
	- Behaviours broken down into small achievable steps
	- Useful when teaching complex chain of events
	- Used by animal trainers
	1. Reinforce any response resembling desired behaviour
	2. Reinforce response that more closely resembles desired behaviour
	3. Continue until only desired behaviour is reinforced

### Primary and Secondary Reinforcers
- **Primary reinforcer** - things that have innate reinforcing qualities
	- Food, water, sex, sleep, pleasure
	- Value does not have to be learned
- **Secondary reinforcer** - things that have no inherent value
	- Praise, money, tokens
	- Value learnt and becomes reinforcing when lined with primary reinforcer

### Cognition and Latent Learning
- Research by Edward C. Tolman found learning could occur without reinforcement
	- Introduced idea that there is a cognitive aspect to learning
- **Cognitive map** - mental picture of layout of an environment
- **Latent learning** - learning that occurs but is not observable in behaviour until there is reason to demonstrate it
	- Children learn behaviours from parents that aren't demonstrated until much older
	- Child learns route to school from watching parent drive, but will not demonstrate until they can drive themselves

### Observational Learning
- **Observational learning** - learning by watching others an then imitating
- **Model** - individual performing imitated behaviour

### Social Learning Theory
- Albert Bandura proposed social learning theory to explain how learning occurs without external reinforcement
	- Believed that observational learning involved more than just imitation
- Steps in Mental Process
	1. **Attention** - focus on behaviour
	2. **Retention** - remember observed behaviour
	3. **Reproduction** - able to perform behaviour
	4. **Motivation** - must want to copy behaviour
- **Vicarious reinforcement** - process where observer sees model rewarded
	- Makes observer more likely to imitate behaviour
- **Vicarious punishment** - process where observer sees model punished
	- Makes observer less likely to imitate behaviour

### Bandura's Bobo Doll Experiment
- Bandura studied modelling of aggressive and violent behaviours
	- Children observed adults act aggressively toward Bobo doll
	- Adult was then either punished, praised, or ignored
	- Children were then given opportunity to play with doll
	- If child seen adult punished, they were less likely to act aggressively toward doll
	- If child seen adult praised/ignored, they were more likely to imitate adult

## Chapter 7 - Thinking and Intelligence

### Concepts and Prototypes
- **Concepts** - categories of linguistic information, images, ideas, or memories
	- Used to see relationships among different element of experience
	- Can be complex and abstract (idea of justice) or concrete (types of birds)
- **Prototypes** - best example or representation of concept
	- Mahatma Gandhi could be prototype of civil disobedience

### Natural and Artificial Concepts
- **Natural concepts**
	- Created "naturally" through either direct or indirect experience
	- E.g. concept of snow
- **Artificial concepts**
	- Defined by specific set of characteristics
	- E.g. properties of geometric shapes

### Schemata
- **Schema** - mental construct consisting of collection of related concepts
	- When schema activated, automatically make assumptions about situation
- **Role schema** - makes assumptions about how individuals in certain roles will behave
- **Event schema (cognitive script)** - set of routine or automatic behaviours
	- Can vary widely among different cultures and countries
	- Dictate behaviour
	- Make habits difficult to break
	- E.g. when riding in elevator, automatically stand facing door
	- Difficult to change because they're automatic
		- When receive a text, we pick up phone and reply
		- Event schema of regularly checking phone makes it difficult to resist picking up while driving

### Language
- **Language** - communication system that involves using words and systematic rules to organize words to transmit information from one individual to another
#### Components of Language
- **Lexicon** - words of given language
- **Grammar** - set of rules used to convey meaning through use of lexicon
- **Phoneme** - basic sound unit
- **Morpheme** - smallest unit of language that convey some type of meaning
- **Semantics** - meaning we drive from morphemes and words
- **Syntax** - way we organize words into sentences


### Language Development
- **Noam Chomsky** - proposed mechanisms underlying language acquisition are biologically determined
	- Language develops in absence of formal instruction
	- Language acquisition follows similar patterns in children from different cultures/backgrounds
- **Critical period** - proficiency at acquiring language is maximal early in life
	- Being deprived of language during critical period impedes ability to fully acquire and use language
#### Case of Genie
- Found at 13 being raised in neglectful and abusive conditions
- Grew up with no social interaction and unable to speak with found
- With help, Genie was able to require vocabulary, but was not able to learn the grammatical aspects of language

### Problem-Solving Strategies
- **Trial and error** - trying solutions until problem solved
	- Plugging in functions to diff eqs and just checking
- **Algorithm** - step-by-step problem-solving formula
	- Wronskian bullshit
- **Heuristic** - general problem-solving framework
	- Assuming $y=e^{rt}$
	- Shortcuts, "rule of thumb"
	- **Working-backwards** - begin solving problem by focusing on end result
	- Break large tasks into smaller steps

### Pitfalls to Problem-Solving
- **Mental Sets** - persistence in approaching problem in a way that has worked in the past
	- Becomes problem when way is no longer working
- **Functional fixedness** - inability to perceive object being used for something other than what it was designed for

### Biases
- **Anchoring bias** - tendency to focus on one piece of information when making a decision or solving a problem
- **Confirmation bias** - tendency to focus on information that confirms existing beliefs
- **Hindsight bias** - leads you to believe that the event you just experienced was predictable, even through it wasn't
- **Representative bias** - tendency to unintentionally stereotype someone or something
- **Availability heuristic** - tendency to make a decision based on information readily available to you, even though it may not be the best example to inform decisions

### Classifying Intelligence
- **Charles Spearman** - believed intelligence consisted of one general factor *g*
	- Focused on commonalities amongst various intellectual abilities
- **Raymond Cattell** - divided intelligence into two components
	- **Crystalized intelligence** - acquired knowledge and ability to achieve it
		- Knowing facts
	- **Fluid intelligence** - ability to see complex relationships and solve problems
		- Knowing how to do something

### Triarchic Theory of Intelligence
- Theory by Robert Sternberg
- Identifies 3 types of intelligence
	- **Analytical** - academic problem solving and computation
	- **Creative** - imaginative and innovative problem solving
	- **Practical** - street smarts and common sense

### Multiple Intelligences Theory
- Theory by Howard Gardner
- Each person possesses at least 8 intelligences
	1. Linguistic
	2. Logical-mathematical
	3. Musical
	4. Bodily kinesthetic
	5. Spatial
	6. Interpersonal
	7. Intrapersonal
	8. Naturalist
- Inter and intrapersonal intelligences combined and called emotional intelligence
	- **Emotional intelligence** - ability to:
		- Understand emotions of yourself and others
		- Show empathy
		- Understand social relationships and cues
		- Regulate your own emotions and respond in appropriate ways

### Measures of Intelligence
- **Intelligence Quotient (IQ)** - score earned on a test designed to measure intelligence
- **Standardization** - manner of administration, scoring, and interpretation of results is consistent
- **Norming** - giving a test to a large population so data can be collected comparing groups
- **David Wechsler's definition of intelligence** - "*the global capacity of a person to act purposefully, to think rationally, and to deal effectively with his environment*"
	- Developed a new IQ test by combining several subsets
		- Tapped into verbal and nonverbal skills
		- One of the most extensively used tests
	- **Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-V)** tests:
		1. Verbal comprehension
		2. Visual spatial
		3. Fluid reasoning
		4. Working memory
		5. Processing speed
- **Flynn Effect** - each generation has a significantly higher IQ than the last
#### Bell Curve
- **Representative sample** - subset of population that accurately represents general population
	- Large sample size
- Mean IQ is 100, Std. Dev is 15 points

### Source of Intelligence
##### Nature vs. Nurture
- **Nature perspective** - intelligence is inherited from a person's parents
	- Heritability of intelligence if often researched using twin studies
	- Identical twins raised together/raised apart exhibit a higher correlation between IQ scores than siblings of fraternal twins raised together
- **Nurture perspective** - intelligence is shaped by a child's developmental environment
	- If parents present children with intellectual stimuli, it will be reflected in the child's intelligence level
- Most believe intelligence is a combination of **both**
- **Range of reaction** - theory that each person responds to the environment in a unique way based on genetic makeup
	- Genetic makeup is fixed quantity
	- Whether you reach full potential is dependent upon environmental factors

## Chapter 8 - Memory

### How Memory Functions
- Memory is a set of processes used to encode, store, and retrieve information over different periods of time
	1. **Encoding** - involves input of information into memory system
	2. **Storage** - retention of encoded information
	3. **Retrieval** - getting information out of memory and back into awareness

### Encoding
- When brain receives information, it
	- Labels it
	- Organizes it with other similar info
	- Connects new concepts to existing concepts
- 2 types of processes
	- **Automatic processing** - encoding of details like time, space, frequency, meaning of words
		- Done without conscious awareness
	- **Effortful processing** - encoding of details that takes time and effort

#### Types of Encoding
- **Semantic encoding** - encoding of words and their meanings
	- Most efficient
	- Involves deeper level of processing
- **Visual encoding** - encoding of images
	- Concrete words are easier to recall than abstract words
- **Acoustic encoding** - encoding of sounds
- **Self-referencing effect** - tendency for an individual to have better memory for information that relates to oneself in comparison to material that has less personal relevance

### Storage: A-S Model
- **Storage** - creation of a permanent record of information
##### Atkinson-Shiffrin Model of Memory
- Information passes through three distinct stages in order to be stored in long-term memory
- Based on belief that memories are processed the same way a computer processes information

#### Sensory Memory
- **Sensory memory** - storage of brief sensory events, such as sights, sounds, and tasetes
	- Stored for a couple seconds
	- First step of processing stimuli
	- If info unimportant, discarded
	- If info valuable, moves on to short-term memory


#### Short-Term Memory (STM)
- **Short-term/working memory** - temporary storage system that processes incoming sensory memory
	- Lasts ~20 seconds
	- Capacity of 7 +/- 2 items
- **Memory consolidation** - transfer of STM to long-term memory
- **Rehearsal** - conscious repetition of information to be remembered

#### Long-Term Memory (LTM)
- **Long-term memory** - continuous storage of information
	- No limit
	- Two components: **explicit** and **implicit**

##### LTM: Explicit Memory
- **Explicit (declarative) memory** - memories of facts and events we can consciously remember and recall/declare
- Contains 2 types:
	- **Semantic** - knowledge of words, concepts, and language
	- **Episodic** - information about events we have personally experienced
		- Autobiographical memory
		- **Hyperthymesia** - highly superior autobiographical memory

##### LTM: Implicit Memories
- **Implicit memory** - memories not part of consciousness
	- Formed through behaviours
- **Procedural** - stores information about how we do things
- Includes behaviours learned through emotional conditioning

#### Retrieval
- **Retrieval** - the act of getting info out of memory storage and back into conscious awareness
- 3 ways to retrieve information
	1. **Recall** - being able to access information without cues
	2. **Recognition** - being able to identify information you have previously learned after encountering it again
	3. **Relearning** - learning information that you previously learned

### Parts of the Brain Involved in Memory
- **Amygdala** - involved in fear and fear memories
	- Processes emotional info important in encoding memories at a deeper level and memory consolidation
- **Hippocampus** - associated with explicit memory, recognition memory, and spatial memory
	- Projects info to cortical regions that give memories meaning and connect them with other memories
	- Involved in memory consolidation
	- Damage leads to inability to process new declarative memories
	- **Patient HM** - had both temporal lobes (and hippocampi) to help control seizures
		- Declarative memory was significantly affected
		- Couldn't form new semantic knowledge or episodic memories
- **Cerebellum** - plays role in processing procedural memories
	- Damage prevents classical conditioning
- **Prefrontal cortex** - involved in remembering semantic tasks
	- PET scans show activation in left interior prefrontal cortex when completing semantic tasks
	- Encoding associated with left frontal activity
	- Retrieval associated with right frontal region

### Flash Bulb Memory
- **Flash bulb memory** - record of atypical and unusual event that has very strong emotional associations
	- Presidential assassinations
	- Moon landing
	- 9/11

### Amnesia
- **Amnesia** - loss of long-term memory that occurs as result of disease, physical trauma, or psychological trauma
	- **Anterograde amnesia** - inability to remember new info after trauma
		- Hippocampus usually affected
	- **Retrograde amnesia** - loss of memory of events occurring prior to trauma
	- **Infantile amnesia** - inability to recall first 3 years of life

### Schacter's 7 Sins of Memory
- Forgetting:
	1. **Transcience** - accessibility of memory decreases over time
	2. **Absentmindedness** - forgetting caused by lapses in attention
	3. **Blocking** - temporary block of accessibility of info (tip-of-the-tongue)
- Distortion:
	4. **Misattribution** - source of memory is confused
	5. **Suggestibility** - false memories
	6. **Bias** - memories distorted by current belief system (rose-tinted glasses)
- Intrusion:
	7. **Persistence** - inability to forget undesirable memories

### Misinformation Effect
- **Misinformation effect paradigm** - after exposure to incorrect info, a person may misremember original event
	- **Loftus Study (1974)**
		- Asked college students to estimate speed of cars
		- Participants were shown car accidents and were asked to describe what happened
		- Different words (smashed, collided, bumped, etc.) changed how they remember scene
		- If they heard the word "glass," they were more than twice as likely to remember seeing glass (false memory)

### Transience/Storage Decay
- Overtime, unused information fades away
- **Ebbinghaus (1885)** - studied process of memorization
	- Ebbinghaus forgetting curve shows how quicky memory for new information decays
		- 50% after 20 minutes
		- 70% after 24 hours

### Bias
- **Stereotypical bias** - involves racial/gender biases
- **Egocentric bias** - involves enhancing memories of past

### Interference
- **Proactive interference** - old information hinders recollection of new information
	- Old locker code 48-6-4
- **Retroactive interference** - new information hinders recollection of old information

### Ways to Enhance Memory
- **Rehearsal** - conscious repetition of information to be remembered
- **Chunking** - organizing information into manageable bits or chunks
	- Phone numbers
- **Elaborative rehearsal** - technique in which you think about the meaning of the new information and its relation to knowledge already stored in your memory
- **Mnemonic devices** - memory aids that help us organize information for encoding

## Chapter 9 - Lifespan Development

### What is Lifespan Development?
- **Lifespan development** - the study of how you change as well as remain the same over the course of your life
- 3 domains:
	- **Physical development** - growth and changes in body and brain, senses, motor skills, and health and wellness
	- **Cognitive development** - learning, attention, memory, language, thinking, reasoning, creativity
	- **Physiological development** - emotions, personality and social relationships

### Continuous vs. Discontinuous Development
- **Continuous development** - views development as a cumulative process, gradually improving on existing skills
- **Discontinuous development** - views development as occurring in unique stages

### Psychological Theory (Erikson)
- **Erik Erikson**
	- Emphasizes social nature of development
	- Argues that personality development takes place across lifespan
	- Based on his belief that social interactions affect our sense of self
- First 4 Stages:

| Stage Name | Age | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Trust vs. Mistrust** | 0-1 Years | Trust that basic needs (nourishment) will be met |
| **Autonomy vs Shame/Doubt** | 1-3 Years | Develop a sense of independence in many tasks |
| **Initiative vs. Guilt** | 3-6 Years | Take initiative on some activities - may develop guilt when unsuccessful or boundaries overstepped |
| **Industry vs. Inferiority** | 7-11 Years | Develop self-confidence in abilities when competent or sense of inferiority when not. |

### Cognitive Theory (Piaget)
- **Piaget**
	- Focus on children's cognitive growth and theorized that cognitive abilities develop through specific stages
	- Piaget believed children develop schemata to help them understand the world
	- When children learn new information, they adjust schemata through assimilation or accommodation
		- **Assimilation** - incorporates information into existing schemata
		- **Accommodation** - change schemata based on new information
		  
| Stage | Age | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Sensorimotor** | 0-2 Years | World experienced through senses and actions |
| **Preoperational** | 2-6 Years | Use words and images to represent things but lack logical reasoning |
| **Concrete optional** | 7-11 | Understand concrete events and analogies logically; perform arithmetical operations |
| **Formal operational** | 12+ | Formal operations, utilize abstract reasoning |

### Psychological Development - Attachment
- **Mary Ainsworth (1970)**
	- Do children differ in the way they bond?
	- Mother and infant placed in a room with toys
	- Stranger enters room and mother leaves
	- After a few minutes, mother returns to comfort child
	- 4 different styles of attachment
		1. **Secure** – child uses the parent as a secure base from which to explore.
			- Child was distressed when mother left, happy to see them when they returned.
			- Common when caregivers are sensitive and responsive to needs.
		2. **Avoidant** – unresponsive to parent, does not use the parent as a secure base, and does not care if parent leaves.
			- Child was slow to show positive reaction when mother returned.
			- Common when caregivers are insensitive and inattentive to needs.
		3. **Resistant** – show clingy behavior, but then reject mothers attempts to interact with them. 
			- Child did not explore the toys, became extremely disturbed and angry when mother left, were difficult to comfort when mother returned.
			- Common when caregiver is inconsistent with level of response.
		4. Disorganized – show odd behavior around caregiver.
			- Behaved oddly when mother left (froze/ran around erratically), tried to run away when mother returned.
			- Common when child has been abused.
