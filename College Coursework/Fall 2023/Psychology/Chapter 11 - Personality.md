### What is Personality
- **Personality** - the long-standing traits and patterns that propel individuals to consistently think, feel, and behave in specific ways
	- Comes from the Latin word *persona* - mask worn by an actor
	- In ancient times, theatrical masks were used to represent/project a specific personality trait

### Historical Perspectives
- **Phrenology**
	- Franz Gail (1780)
	- Proposed that distances between bumps on skull reveal a person's personality traits, character, and mental abilities
	- Discredited for a lack of empirical support
- **Wilhelm Wundt (19th century)**
	- Suggested that personality could be described using two major axes
		- **Emotional/non-emotional** - separated strong emotions (melancholic, choleric) from the weak emotions (phlegmatic, sanguine)
		- **Changeable/unchangeable** - divided the changeable temperaments (choleric, sanguine) from the unchangeable ones (melancholic, phlegmatic)
- **Psychodynamic Perspectives (20th century)**
	- **Sigmund Freud**
		- First comprehensive theory of personality explaining both normal and abnormal behaviours
		- Proposed that unconscious drives influenced by sex, aggression, and childhood sexuality influence personality
	- **Neo-Freudians**
		- Agreed that childhood experiences matter
		- Less emphasis on sex
		- Focused on social environment and effects of culture on personality

### Levels of Consciousness
- **Unconscious** - mental activity that we are unaware of and are unable to access
- According to Freud:
	- We are only aware of one-tenth of our mind's activities and most of it remains hidden from us in our unconscious
	- Unacceptable urges and desires are kept into our unconscious through repression
	- The information in our unconscious affects our behaviour, although we are unaware of it
- **Freudian slip** - Freud suggested that slips of the tongue are sexual/aggressive urges accidentally slipping out of our unconscious

### Id, Ego, and Superego
- Freud posted that personality results from efforts to balance two competing forces
	1. Biological aggressive and pleasure-seeking drives
	2. Internal (socialized) control over these pleasure-seeking drives
- Freud described this process as an interaction between tree systems
	- **Id** - contains primitive urges (for hunger, thirst, sex)
		- Impulsive, instinctual
		- Operates on *pleasure principle* - seeks immediate gratification
	- **Superego** - develops through interactions with others, learning social rules for right and wrong
		- Moral compass that tells us how we should behave based on rules
		- Strives for perfection
		- Judges behaviour - leads to feelings of pride or guilt
	- **Ego (self)** - attempts to balance id with superego
		- Rational
		- Operates on the *reality principle* - help the id satisfy desires in a realistic id
		- Part of the personality seen by others
- **Effects on Personality**
	- Balanced id and ego $\to$ healthy personality
	- Imbalanced id and ego $\to$ neurosis (tendency to experience negative emotions), anxiety disorders, unhealthy behaviours

### Defense Mechanisms
- **Defense mechanisms** - unconscious protective behaviours that work to reduce anxiety
- Used by ego to restore balance between id and superego
- Freud believed them to be used by everyone but that overuse could be problematic
	- **Denial** - refusing to accept real events because they are unpleasant
	- **Displacement** - transferring inappropriate urges or behaviours onto a more acceptable or less threatening target
	- **Projection** - attributing unacceptable desires to others
	- **Rationalization** - justifying behaviours by substituting acceptable reasons for less-acceptable real reasons
	- **Reaction Formation** - reducing anxiety by adopting beliefs contrary to your own beliefs
	- **Regression** - returnign to coping strategies for less mature stages of development
	- **Repression** - suppressing painful memories and thoughts
	- **Sublimation** - redirecting unacceptable desires through socially acceptable channels

### Stages of Psychosexual Development
- Freud theorized that children pass through five psychosexual stages
- In each stage, id is focused on different erogenous zone (part of the body)
- Lack of proper nurturing and parenting during conflicts results in person becoming stuck/fixated in that stage
#### Oral Stage
- Birth - 1 year
- **Erogenous zone** - mouth
- **Pleasure** - from eating and sucking
- **Major conflict** - being weaned from bottle or breast
- **Adult fixation** - smoking, overeating, nail-biting
