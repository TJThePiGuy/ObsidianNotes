## 1.2 The Theory of Rational Choice

A decision-maker chooses the best action according to her preferences, among all the actions available to her. Her "rationality" lies in the consistency of her decisions when faced with different sets of available actions, not in nature of likes and dislikes.

### 1.2.1 Actions

The theory is based on a model with two components
- a set $A$ consisting of all the actions available to the decision maker
- a specification of the decision-maker's preferences

### 1.2.2 Preferences and Payoff Functions

We assume the following:
- The decision-maker, when presented with any pair of actions, knows which she prefers
- These preferences are consistent (if she prefers $a$ over $b$ and $b$ over $c$, then she prefers $a$ over $c$)
We can describe a decision-maker's preferences with a *payoff function*, which associates a number with each action such that for a payoff function $u$ and actions $a\in A$ and $b\in B$,
$$
u(a)>u(b)\text{ iff the decision-maker prefers }a\text{ to }b.
$$
A decision-maker's preferences here, and therefore the payoff function, convey only *ordinal* information; the actual values of $u(a)$, $u(b)$, $u(c)$, etc., mean **nothing**. The only thing that matters is their relative order. If $u$ is a payoff function and $v$ is another payoff function for which $$
v(a)>v(b)\text{ iff }u(a)>u(b),
$$
then $v$ also represents the preferences. 

### 1.2.3 The Theory of Rational Choice

**The theory of rational choice** - the action chosen by a decision-maker is at least as good, according to her preferences, as every other available action
