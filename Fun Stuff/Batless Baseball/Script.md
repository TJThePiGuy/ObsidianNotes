> *This is probably gonna sound stupid, but what if Barry Bonds had played without a bat?*

In April 2017, Jon Bois of the Secret Base YouTube channel released a video in which he reenacts Barry Bonds's 2004 season - without swinging his bat. After his simulation, he concluded that Barry Bonds would have an on-base percentage of 0.608, second in MLB history only to his actual 2004 season of 0.609....

What?
